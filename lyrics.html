         <pre>
    Did you really think
    I'd just forgive and forget, no
    After catching you with her
    Your blood should run cold, so cold
    You, you two timing, cheap lying, wannabe
    You're a fool
    If you thought that I'd just let this go

    I see red, red, oh red
    A gun to your head, head, to your head
    Now all I see is red, red, red

    Did you really just say
    She didn't mean anything, oh
    I'll remember those words
    When I come for your soul, your soul
    Now that you, you dug your own grave
    Now lie in it
    You're so cruel
    But revenge is a dish best served cold

    I see red, red, oh red
    A gun to your head, head, to your head, oh
    Executioner style, and there won't be no trial
    Don't you know that you're better off dead
    All I see is red, red, oh red
    Now all I see is

    Run, hide
    Oh, you're so done
    Better sleep with one eye open tonight

    I see red, red, oh red, oh
    A gun to your head, head, to your head, oh
    Executioner style, and there won't be no trial
    Don't you know that you're better off dead
    All I see is red, red, oh red
    Now all I see is red, red
    </pre>
